# Python for Data Science
This repository contains the code examples and projects I have completed during the "Python for Data Science" course offered by PWSkills. The course provided a comprehensive introduction to Python programming and its applications in the field of data science.

## Course Overview
The "Python for Data Science" course by PWSkills covered the following topics:

Introduction to Python programming language
Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis (such as NumPy and Pandas)
Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Machine learning basics using scikit-learn
Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
Model evaluation and validation techniques
Advanced topics in data science (e.g., deep learning, natural language processing)
