# Data-Science-Masters

This repository contains the code examples and projects I have completed during the "Data Science Masters" course offered by PWSkills as well as from other sorces such as YouTube and Google. This Repository will help you get the gist of the code that you require for a revision and for the complete learning from the scratch.



## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific topic or a project. Here's a brief overview of the folder structure:

1) Introduction: Contains introductory examples and exercises to get started with Python programming.
2) Data Manipulation: Includes code snippets and projects related to data manipulation using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
3) Data Visualization: Demonstrates various techniques for visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4) Machine Learning: Covers the basics of machine learning with scikit-learn, including regression, classification, and clustering algorithms.
5) Exploratory Data Analysis: Provides examples of exploratory data analysis techniques and feature engineering.
6) Model Evaluation: Explores model evaluation and validation techniques, including cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
7) Advanced Topics: Contains advanced topics in data science, such as deep learning and natural language processing.

## Getting Started
To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:botzaifa/Data-Science-Masters.git
