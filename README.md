# Data-Science-Masters

This repository contains the code examples and projects I have completed during the "Python for Data Science" course offered by PWSkills. The course provided a comprehensive introduction to Python programming and its applications in the field of data science.



## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific topic or project covered in the course. Here's a brief overview of the folder structure:

1) Introduction: Contains introductory examples and exercises to get started with Python programming.
2) Data Manipulation: Includes code snippets and projects related to data manipulation using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
3) Data Visualization: Demonstrates various techniques for visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4) Machine Learning: Covers the basics of machine learning with scikit-learn, including regression, classification, and clustering algorithms.
5) Exploratory Data Analysis: Provides examples of exploratory data analysis techniques and feature engineering.
6) Model Evaluation: Explores model evaluation and validation techniques, including cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
7) Advanced Topics: Contains advanced topics in data science, such as deep learning and natural language processing.
