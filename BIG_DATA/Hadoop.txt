HADOOP: 

What is a Hadoop?
-> Hadoop is a framework for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of commodity computers

It comprises of:

HADOOP = HDFS + MapReduce

HDFS (Reliable Shared Storage)
MapReduce (Distributed Computation)



Why do we use Hadoop?
There are various types of File systems present inside our different kinds of laptops

Like for eg:
- Windows contains: FAT32, NTFS
- MAC contains: HFS, HFS+
- Linux contains: ext3, ext4, XFS
These different types contains different file and volume limit 

If we want to keep track of everything without being a difficulty in between, we use Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) which is a genralized form of file system (distributed file system)

We can keep track of all our nodes and servers irrespective of the device

It is also used to keep track of all the Meta Data aswell.

(Note: It is not a replace of your existing file system it is sitting above your filesystem)



Advantages of HDFS:
1. Supports distributed Processing
	- Blocks (not as whole files)
2. Ability to Handle Failures
	- Replicate Blocks
3. Scalability
	- Able to support future expansion
4. Cost effective
	- Commodity hardware



Functions of a File System:
- Control how data is stored and retrieved
- Meta data about the files and folders
- Permissions and security
- Manage storage space efficiently
