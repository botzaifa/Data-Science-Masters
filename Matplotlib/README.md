# Workflow of the Code:
1. Importing the libraries and data
2. Simple line Graph
3. Subplot using axis and figure method
4. Individual graphs in the same figure
5. Combined labels 
6. Combined x-axis 
7. Horzontal Graphs
8. Saving the Subplots as png
9. Plotting 2 different figures
10. Saving those 2 individual Graphs
