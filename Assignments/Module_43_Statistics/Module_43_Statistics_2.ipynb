    "1. **`Mean:`** This is the average of all the values in a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers because it takes into account the magnitude of each value. It is commonly used when the dataset is approximately normally distributed or symmetrically distributed around a central value.\n",

    "\n",

    "2. **`Median:`** The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the value at the exact center. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is not affected by extreme values (outliers) in the dataset.\n",

    "3. **`Mode:`** The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. Unlike the mean and median, which are based on actual values, the mode is a value derived from the frequencies of values in the dataset.\n",

    "- Covariance is often used in financial analysis and portfolio management to assess the risk and return of assets relative to each other.\n",
    "- Correlation is widely used in many fields, including economics, biology, psychology, and social sciences, to study relationships between variables and make predictions.\n",

    "**6. `Overall:`**\n",
    "- Covariance and correlation are related but distinct measures of the relationship between variables. Covariance measures the direction and strength of the linear relationship but is influenced by the units of measurement. Correlation, on the other hand, standardizes this measurement, making it more interpretable and allowing for comparisons between different pairs of variables. \n"

    "- **Mean**: Outliers can pull the mean towards them because the mean is sensitive to extreme values. A single extreme outlier can greatly increase or decrease the mean depending on its value.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Median**: The median is less affected by outliers because it is simply the middle value when the data is ordered. Outliers have no effect on the median unless they affect the order of values around the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mode**: Outliers generally do not affect the mode because the mode is the most frequent value(s) in the dataset, which is often less sensitive to extreme values unless the outlier occurs very frequently.\n",
