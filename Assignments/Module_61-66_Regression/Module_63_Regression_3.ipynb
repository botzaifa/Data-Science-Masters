    "- **Regularization:** Ridge regression adds a penalty to the size of the coefficients beta_j, which helps to prevent overfitting, whereas OLS does not include this penalty.\n",
    "- **Coefficient Shrinkage:** Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not set any coefficients exactly to zero, unlike Lasso regression which can perform feature selection.\n",

    "1. **Linearity:** The relationship between the predictors and the response variable is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence:** The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity:** Constant variance of the errors.\n",
    "4. **Normality:** The residuals (errors) of the model are normally distributed.\n",
    "5. **No Perfect Multicollinearity:** While Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity better than OLS, perfect multicollinearity (i.e., perfectly correlated predictors) should still be avoided.\n"

    "- **Cross-Validation:** The most common method to select \\(\\lambda\\) is through cross-validation. Different values of \\(\\lambda\\) are tested, and the value that results in the best model performance (e.g., lowest cross-validated RMSE) is chosen.\n",
    "- **Grid Search:** A range of \\(\\lambda\\) values is defined, and the model is trained for each value. The best \\(\\lambda\\) is selected based on performance metrics.\n",
    "- **Regularization Path:** Some algorithms (e.g., `glmnet` in R) can provide a path of solutions for different \\(\\lambda\\) values, helping to visualize and choose the best \\(\\lambda\\)."
