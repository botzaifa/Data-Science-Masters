    "ANS: a)MongoDB is a non-relational, document-oriented database that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing data. It is designed to handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. MongoDB stores data in a format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are database systems that do not use the traditional tabular relational model of SQL databases. Instead, they provide flexible schemas and data models that can adapt to changing data structures and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in certain scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible data models: MongoDB's document-oriented nature allows for flexible schema designs. It can handle semi-structured and unstructured data efficiently, making it suitable for applications with evolving or unpredictable data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability and performance: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it a good choice for applications with high write loads and large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rapid development and iteration: MongoDB's flexible schema and query language enable developers to quickly iterate and adapt their data models as application requirements change. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Real-time analytics: MongoDB's query capabilities and aggregation framework make it well-suited for real-time analytics and data processing tasks. "

    "ANS: The Prominent features of MongoDB are as Follows:\n",
    "1. Document-oriented model: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON. Documents can have varying structures and fields, providing flexibility to handle evolving data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability and High Availability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers or nodes. It supports automatic sharding, allowing for easy distribution of data and workload across the cluster. Replication is built-in, ensuring data redundancy and high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Indexing and Querying: MongoDB provides efficient indexing mechanisms to support fast query execution. It supports various types of indexes, including single-field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes. MongoDB's query language is rich and expressive, enabling complex queries and aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexible Schema: MongoDB offers a dynamic schema design, allowing documents in a collection to have different structures and fields. This flexibility makes it suitable for scenarios where data models evolve over time or where the schema is not predefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Replication and Fault Tolerance: MongoDB provides automatic data replication through replica sets. Replica sets consist of multiple copies of data distributed across different nodes, ensuring data redundancy and fault tolerance. If a node fails, the system automatically promotes a replica to the primary role, ensuring high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally by adding more servers or nodes to a cluster. It allows for seamless distribution of data across multiple nodes, enabling increased capacity and improved performance as the workload grows."
