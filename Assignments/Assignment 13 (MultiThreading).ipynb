A thread is a lightweight subprocess, also known as a \"lightweight process,\" that can perform tasks independently while sharing the same memory space.\n",

This function can be useful for monitoring the number of active threads in a program, allowing you to check the concurrency and workload of the threaded application.\n",

It returns a list that contains all the Thread objects currently alive, regardless of their state (e.g., running, blocked, or terminated).

When you call join() on a Thread object, it blocks the calling thread until the target thread has finished executing.

By default, join() blocks indefinitely until the thread terminates. \n",

    "ANS: The advantages and disadvantages of multithreading are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Advantages:\n",
    "1. Increased Performance: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of multiple threads, enabling tasks to be executed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enhanced Responsiveness: Multithreading helps keep an application responsive, particularly when performing tasks that involve waiting, such as network operations or input/output operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource Sharing: Threads within a process share the same memory space, enabling efficient sharing of data and resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modular Design: Multithreading allows for a modular design approach, where different parts of a program can be divided into separate threads, each responsible for a specific task. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Disadvantages:\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreaded programs can be more complex to design, implement, and debug compared to single-threaded programs. Handling thread synchronization, race conditions, and deadlocks can introduce complexity and increase the potential for bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Synchronization Overhead: When multiple threads access shared data concurrently, proper synchronization mechanisms must be employed to prevent data corruption and ensure data integrity. These synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, add overhead and can introduce performance penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Increased Memory Usage: Each thread in a multithreaded program requires its own stack and resources, which can result in increased memory usage compared to a single-threaded program. This can be a concern when dealing with resource-constrained environments or when creating a large number of threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Difficulty in Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and thread interference. Identifying and resolving these issues requires careful analysis and testing, which can increase the development and debugging time."

    "ANS: Deadlocks and race conditions are two common synchronization problems that can occur in multithreaded or concurrent programs. \n",
    "1. Deadlocks: A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources they hold. In a deadlock, none of the involved threads can proceed, resulting in a program freeze or deadlock situation.\n",
    "2. Race Conditions: A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes. It arises when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently and attempt to modify the same resource simultaneously. The result of a race condition is unpredictable and can lead to incorrect or inconsistent program behavior. "
