    "1. Parallel Execution: Multiple processes can work concurrently, utilizing the full potential of multi-core systems and reducing the overall execution time for CPU-bound tasks.\n",

    "2. Improved Performance: By taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores, multiprocessing can significantly enhance the performance of computationally intensive operations.\n",
