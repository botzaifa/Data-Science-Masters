    "\n",
    "**ANS**:\n",
    "- `Precision`: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions by calculating the ratio of true positives (TP) to all predicted positives (TP + FP). It reflects how often the model correctly predicts positive instances out of all positive predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Recall`: Measures the model’s ability to identify actual positive instances by calculating the ratio of TP to all actual positives (TP + FN). It shows how well the model captures true positive cases."

    "\n",
    "- F1 = 2 × (Precision + Recall) / (Precision × Recall)\n",

    "\n",
    "- `ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve` plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the False Positive Rate across different thresholds.\n",
    "- `AUC (Area Under the Curve)` measures the area under the ROC curve, indicating the model’s ability to distinguish between classes. A higher AUC reflects better overall classification performance, with values closer to 1 indicating better separability."

    "a. `The choice of metric depends on`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class balance: For imbalanced datasets, metrics like F1 score and AUC are often more informative.\n",
    "- Problem requirements: If minimizing false negatives is critical, prioritize recall; if reducing false positives is more important, prioritize precision.\n",
    "- Threshold adjustment: When threshold flexibility is required, use ROC-AUC for performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. `Multiclass Classification` distinguishes among more than two classes (e.g., classifying images as cat, dog, or bird). It requires specialized algorithms or adaptations of binary classification techniques to manage multiple outcomes. Whereas Binary classification differentiates between two classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam)."

    "1. `Data Collection and Preprocessing`: Gather data and preprocess it (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features).\n",

    "3. `Model Selection`: Choose an algorithm that supports multiclass classification (e.g., Logistic Regression with Softmax).\n",

    "5. `Hyperparameter Tuning`: Use Grid Search or Randomized Search to optimize parameters.\n",

This setup allows for high availability, disaster recovery, and choosing the best platform features for specific tasks (e.g., data storage in one cloud, model serving in another)."
