    "ANS: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of data. Databases are used to store and manage vast amounts of information. SQL databases are based on a relational data model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data. Whereas, NoSQL databases, on the other hand, employ a variety of data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores, depending on the specific NoSQL database type. They offer more flexible schemas and are designed to handle large-scale distributed data with high velocity and variety."
