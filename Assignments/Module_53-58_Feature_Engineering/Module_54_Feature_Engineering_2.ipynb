    "**ANS:** The Drawbacks of using the Filter method are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `No Consideration of Feature Interactions`: The Filter method evaluates features independently of each other and the learning algorithm. It does not consider potential interactions or dependencies between features, which can be crucial for some machine learning tasks. Ignoring feature interactions may lead to suboptimal feature selection and less accurate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `No Optimization for Specific Learning Algorithm`: Since the Filter method is model-agnostic, it may not be optimized for the specific learning algorithm being used. Different machine learning algorithms may have different feature requirements, and selecting features solely based on their individual relevance may not lead to the best performance for a particular algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Inability to Handle Redundant Features`: Filter methods may not handle redundancy among features well. If multiple features are highly correlated with each other but equally relevant to the target, the filter method may select all of them, which can increase model complexity without providing significant benefits."

    "\n",
    "1. `Large Datasets`: The Filter method is computationally efficient and scales well to large datasets with a high number of features. When dealing with massive datasets, the time and resources required for Wrapper methods can become prohibitive, making the Filter method a more practical choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Low Computational Resources`: If you have limited computational resources or cannot afford extensive model training due to time constraints, the Filter method can be a more feasible option.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Handling High-Dimensional Data`: When dealing with high-dimensional data, Wrapper methods may suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In such cases, the Filter method's simplicity and low computational overhead can be advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Handling Redundant Features`: The Filter method, especially correlation-based techniques, can be useful for detecting and eliminating highly correlated features, which can be helpful in reducing redundancy and improving model interpretability."
