Once you are exposed to the RAW DATA follow these steps:

Step-1: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):-

	1. Check for Numerical Features (histogram, PDF)
	2. Check for Categorical Features
	3. Missing Values (Visualize all the Graphs)
	4. Outliers (Box Plot)
	5. Cleaning of data


Step-2: Handling the Missing Values	
	1. Mean 
	2. Median 
	3. Mode

Step-3: Handling the Imbalanced Datasets

Step-4: Treating the Outliers

Step-5: Scaling down the data (Standardization, Normalization)

Step-6: Converting the Categorical Features into Numerical Feature

Step-7: Feature Selection
	(Include only those attributes which are necessary)
	1. Correlation
	2. K-Neighbours
	3. ChiSquare
	4. Genetic Algorithm
	5. Feature Importance (Extra Tree Classifier)
