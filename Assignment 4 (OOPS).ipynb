    "### Ans: The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class in OOP. This allows for better data security and prevents outside interference with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting the properties and methods of the existing class. This allows for code reuse, improved organization of classes, and helps to reduce code redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object or method to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism refers to the ability of a single method to have different implementations in different classes, or for objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. In OOP, abstraction refers to the ability to define abstract classes or interfaces, which provide a blueprint for derived classes but cannot be instantiated on their own. This helps to reduce complexity and improve code maintainability."

    "### ANS: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), 'self' is a reference to the object that is calling a method. It is used to access the properties and methods of that object from within the method. A simple answer to why 'self' is used in OOP is that it allows us to differentiate between the properties and methods of an object and those of the class itself. When we define a method in a class, we need to use 'self' as the first parameter in the method definition to indicate that it is an instance method that operates on the object itself. In short, 'self' is used in OOP to reference the object that is calling a method and allows us to access its properties and methods from within that method."
