    "## Internal Covariate shift\n",
    "\n",
    "- The concept of covariate shift pertains to the change that occurs in the distribution of the input to a learning system. In deep networks, this distribution can be influenced by parameters across all input layers. Consequently, even minor changes in the network can have a significant impact on its output. This effect gets magnified as the signal propagates through the network, which can result in a shift in the distribution of the inputs to internal layers. This phenomenon is known as internal covariate shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When inputs are whitened (i.e., have zero mean and unit variance) and are uncorrelated, they tend to converge faster during training. However, internal covariate shift can have the opposite effect, as it introduces changes to the distribution of inputs that can slow down convergence. Therefore, to mitigate this effect, techniques like batch normalization have been developed to normalize the inputs to each layer in the network based on statistics of the current mini-batch."

This makes it difficult for the network to learn and can result in slow convergence during training. To overcome this problem we can use the following:\n",

    "## Steps involved in batch normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "1) During training, for each mini-batch of data, compute the mean and variance of the activations of each layer. This can be done using the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: $\\mu_B = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m x_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance: $\\sigma_B^2 = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - \\mu_B)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, $m$ is the size of the mini-batch, and $x_i$ is the activation of the $i$-th neuron in the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Normalize the activations of each layer in the mini-batch using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\hat{x_i} = \\frac{x_i - \\mu_B}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_B^2 + \\epsilon}}$\n",
    "Here, $\\epsilon$ is a small constant added for numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Scale and shift the normalized activations using the learned parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y_i = \\gamma \\hat{x_i} + \\beta$\n",
    "- The parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ are learned during training using backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) During inference, the running mean and variance of each layer are used for normalization instead of the mini-batch statistics. These running statistics are updated using a moving average of the mini-batch statistics during training."

    "\n",
    "- Improved training performance: Batch normalization reduces the internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of the activations of each layer due to changes in the distribution of the inputs. This allows the network to converge faster and with more stable gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization: Batch normalization acts as a form of regularization by adding noise to the activations of each layer, which can help prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
